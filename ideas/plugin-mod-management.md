# Plugin/Mod Management

## Status - Idea

## Description

The user should be able to place mod/plugin jar files in a specific folder to associate them with a given server type similar to how Multicraft handles it. When a new forge or bukkit/spigot/paper server is created, the user should be presented with all the available mods on the system and be able to choose which ones to install along with the server.

A better way to handle this might be to include a proper mod management system similar to how the twitch desktop client manages Minecraft mods.
