# Server Jar Update

## Description

Provide some way for the user to update minecraft server jars. Multicraft provides this feature, but it is hidden away and very unintuitive to use and add new servers to.

Also provide the option for the servers to automatically update the jar file.
Also provide the option for servers to automatically restart when the jar file is updated.
